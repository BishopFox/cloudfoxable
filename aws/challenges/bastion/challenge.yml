  **Overview**

  - **Default state:** Disabled
  - **Estimated Cost:** $3.88/month
  - **Starting Point:** `arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/ctf-starting-user`

  **CloudFoxable Setup**

  - Edit `cloudfoxable/aws/terraform.tfvars`
  - Switch the challenge flag to true: `bastion_enabled = true`
  - `terraform apply`

  **Challenge Details**

  This challenge will set up your bastion host that you can use for all other challenges in this "Assumed Breach: Application Compromise/Network Access" category.

  The easiest way to access an EC2 is to use SSM.

  1. Once the challenge is deployed, run `cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable instances -v2` to find the instance ID.
  2. Next, you'll want in to install the [Session Manager plugin](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/systems-manager/latest/userguide/session-manager-working-with-install-plugin.html)
  3. Check out the `loot` file from the instances command to find the command needed to connect to the instance with SSM.
  4. From there, use `cloudfox` to figure out what IAM permissions you have access to and find the flag.

  **Cleanup Tasks**

  - Edit `cloudfoxable/aws/terraform.tfvars`
  - Switch the challenge flag to false: `bastion_enabled = false`
  - `terraform apply`
