  **Overview**

  - **Default state:** Disable
  - **Estimated Cost:** $27/month
  - **Starting Point:** `arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:user/ctf-starting-user`

  **CloudFoxable Setup**

  - Edit `cloudfoxable/aws/terraform.tfvars`
  - Switch the challenge flag to true: `search1and2_enabled = true`
  - Run `terraform apply`

  **Challenge**

  This is the second phase of the `search` challenge. It is often the case that the blast radius of a cloud breach extends beyond the cloud infrastructure itself. See if you can find a path that starts where Search1 left off but leads somewhere outside your CloudFoxable playground. That's where you'll find the flag.

  **Cleanup Tasks**

  - Edit `cloudfoxable/aws/terraform.tfvars`
  - Switch the challenge flag to false: `search1and2_enabled = false`
  - Run `terraform apply`
