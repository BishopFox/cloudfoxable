hints:
- |-
  As always, you'll want to run the cloudfox `permissions` command on the user you just "compromised".  If you only want to know what a single user/role can do, you can use the --principal flag, like this:

  `cloudfox  aws -p cloudfoxable permissions --principal kent -v2`

  But to really get started on this challenge you'll also want to run this cloudfox command:
  `cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable role-trusts -v2`
