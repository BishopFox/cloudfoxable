  **Challenge Details**

  TL;DR: You've just gained access to the role `Ertz`. Can you find and access the `its-another-secret` flag?

  A lot of the challenges in the category **Assumed Breach: Principal** will have you assume into a role to simulate a new starting point. You'll technically start as `ctf-starting-user`, but your first action will be to assume the role `Ertz` listed above. This is to simulate a scenario where you've just gained access to the role `Ertz`.

  You can do this the "hard way" by running `aws --profile cloudfoxable sts assume-role --role-arn arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/Ertz --role-session-name Ertz` and then using that output to set up a new profile or environment variables.

  Or, you can do it the easy way and create a new profile that does the role assumption for you!

  Edit `~/.aws/config` and add the following profile:

  ```
  [profile ertz]
  region = us-west-2
  role_arn = arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/Ertz
  source_profile = cloudfoxable
  ```

  Now verify it!
  ```
  ‚ùØ aws --profile ertz sts get-caller-identity
  {
      "UserId": "AROAQXHJKLZKFYSRACOES:botocore-session-1684201365",
      "Account": "ACCOUNT_ID",
      "Arn": "arn:aws:sts::ACCOUNT_ID:assumed-role/Ertz/botocore-session-1684201365"
  }
  ```

  For each of these challenges, and on a cloud penetration test, the next thing you'll want to do is see what permissions the assumed breach user has, and see if any of them are "interesting".

  If you've completed `It's a secret`, the rest of this challenge will look the same. The main goal here is to make sure you are comfortable assuming new roles. Good luck!

  Once you have confirmed you have access to the Ertz role, you'll want to do two things:
  * Check what permisisons Ertz has
  * Find the `its-another-secret` secret
