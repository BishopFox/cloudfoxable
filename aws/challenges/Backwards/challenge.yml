  - **Default state:** Enabled

  - **Starting Point:** `arn:aws:secretsmanager:us-west-2:ACCOUNTID:secret:DomainAdministrator-Credentials-SUFFIX`

  **CloudFoxable Setup**

  None required

  **Challenge Details**

  In some challenges, you might not see an IAM role or an IP address as the starting point, but rather, an interesting ARN or something like that.

  Sometimes during cloud penetration tests, we first find something interesting and then work backwards to see who has access to it. Is it just the Administrators? Well, that's not really a big deal. Is it all developers, or all users, or anyone in the world? That might be a really big deal!

  So in this challenge, we'd like you to get comfortable finding who has access to the *interesting thing*. For now, the interesting thing is just another secret in secretsmanager, but in later challenges, and on cloud penetration tests, this approach will become quite important.

  So, go find out who has access to `DomainAdministrator-Credentials` in `secretsmanager` and then use your `cloudfoxable` profile to access that role and grab the secret.

  If your stuck, try running the permissions command in cloudfox and grepping for the word secret:

  `cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable aws permissions -v2 | grep -i secret`

  Do you see user or role that has the permission to get all secretsmanager secret values, or even just the value of the secret we want?
- |-
  Now that you've found the role that can access the secret, let's cross our fingers and hope we can assume that role from our cloudfoxable profile, which maps to `ctf-starting-user`.

  To do that, you can check the permissions of the ctf-starting-user, but no luck, no `sts:assumerole` granting access to our target role.

  However, role trust policies are tricky. If a role trust policy specifies a principal in the same account specifically, that principal can assume it WITHOUT needing sts:assumerole permission. Yes, it's confusing, welcome to the club.

  This means that you need to not only check your permissions, you need to check all of the role trust policies in the account. Luckily, there's the `role-trusts` command in cloudfox to help you!

  Try:

  `cloudfox -p cloudfoxable aws role-trusts -v2`

  Find our target role, and see who it trusts?
- |-
  Now that you confirmed that we can assume the role `Alexander-Arnold` from our `ctf-starting-user`, let's do it!

  Just like the previous challenge "It's another secret", make a new profile for the role assumption:

  ```
  [profile Alexander-Arnold]
  region = us-west-2
  role_arn = arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/Alexander-Arnold
  source_profile = cloudfoxable
  ```

  At this point, head all the way back to cloudfox secrets command loot file and grab the command to get the secret!
