  **Overview**

  * **Default state:** Enabled
  * **Estimated Cost:** No cost until you create resources (required)
  * **Starting Point:** `arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNT_ID:role/christian_pulisic`

  **CloudFoxable Setup**

  Create profile for `pulisic`

  ```
  [profile pulisic]
  region = us-west-2
  role_arn = arn:aws:iam::ACCOUNTID:role/christian_pulisic
  source_profile = cloudfoxable
  ```

  **Challange Details**

  In the 2022 FIFA World Cup, Christian Pulisic put his body on the line to net a crucial goal for the USA, ensuring their progression beyond the group stage: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y7VA30UYlQo. He did what he had to do, even though he knew it was going to hurt.

  Similarly, during a penetration test, whether in a cloud environment or otherwise, you might identify a exploit path that won't be pleasant to exploit, but you know the end result will be worth it.

  For this challenge, you have just gained access to the role `christian_pulisic`. The trophy target for this challenge is in an s3 bucket named pain-s3-\[randon-chars] in your account.

  Start with christian_pulisic and follow the permissions until you see the path. That's the easy part :). Executing the exploit chain... not so easy.

  **Cleanup Tasks**

  Don't forgot to remove any resources you created to solve this challenge. This is good practice, because we must also keep track of things we create on a penetration test and remove them when we are finished with the attack chain.
