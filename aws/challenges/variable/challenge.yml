  **Overview**

  - **Default state:** Disabled
  - **Estimated Cost:** $13/month (this one) + $4/month (bastion) = $18/month
  - **Starting Point:** The `bastion` EC2 instance

  **CloudFoxable Setup**

  - Edit `cloudfoxable/aws/terraform.tfvars`
  - Switch the challenge flag to true: `bastion_enabled = true`
  - Switch the challenge flag to true: `variable_enabled = true`
  - `terraform apply`

  **Challenge Details**

  1. Connect to the bastion host using SSM (see details in the bastion challenge).
  2. In this challenge, you are not exploiting any IAM permissions attached to the instance; rather, you are exploiting the fact that you have a network position inside the VPC. This means you can reach network services that are only accessible via network foothold.
  3. If you haven't already, re-run `cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable all-checks`, and analyze the output. Does anything stand out to you?

  **Cleanup Tasks**

  - Edit `cloudfoxable/aws/terraform.tfvars`
  - Switch the challenge flag to false: `bastion_enabled = false`
  - Switch the challenge flag to true: `variable_enabled = false`
  - `terraform apply`

hints:

  You'll need to put pieces together from two seperate `cloudfox` commands to solve
  this one.
