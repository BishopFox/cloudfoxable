  **Challenge Details**

  What does it mean when we say something is "public" in the cloud? Do you need an IP address to be public? What if a resource is accessible to anyone in the world, provided they have an AWS account (any AWS account). That seems close enough to public to scare me!

  Note: FWIW, there is a policy on the resource in question that will only allow you to exploit it from your IP address to prevent misuse)

  There are two cloudfox commands that can help you here.

  The more general command, `resource-trusts` tries to enumerate many types of resources that have support resource policies.

  `cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable resource-trusts -v2`.

  There's another cloudfox command that will actually show you how to exploit the topic.

  Run the sns command in cloudfox, and make sure to check the loot!

  `cloudfox aws -p cloudfoxable sns -v2`

  To pull off the exploit, you'll need to set up some type of listener on a public IP so that you can subscribe to the topic.

  In a pinch, you can even use netcat.

  If you have subscribed and you are not getting messages, make sure you have subscribed
  to the correct topic... the one that only allows sns:subscribe & sns:publish from
  your IP.
